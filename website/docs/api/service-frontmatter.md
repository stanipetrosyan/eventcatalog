# `Service Frontmatter Config`

## Overview {#overview}

Services are just markdown files, with this comes the use of Content, MDX components and also [front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).

Here is an example of the event frontmatter you will find in your event files.

```mdx"
---
name: Basket Service
summary: |
  CRUD based API to handle Basket interactions for users of the shopping website.
owners:
    - dboyne
repository:
  language: JavaScript
  url: https://github.com/boyney123/pretend-basket-service
---
```

## Required fields {#required-fields}

```

## Optional fields {#optional-fields}

### `summary` {#summary}
